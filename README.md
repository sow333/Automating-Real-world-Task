# Automating-Real-world-Task 

Performing repetitive tasks can bore even the most resilient of us out of our minds. Lucky for us, the digital age we live in offers us a bevy of tools to relieve ourselves of that sort of tedious labor.

While that particular ability may seem contingent upon our knowledge of programming languages, I’m here to tell you that automation is definitely for you, even if you’re a complete newbie to the field. Even though it might seem daunting at first, I promise you that building your first script will feel very rewarding and your new skills will save you lots of time in the long run.

Start by thinking about repetitive tasks your workday entails and identify those that you think could be automated. Divide your workload into smaller sub-tasks and think of ways you could automate at least some of them.

Once you find a suitable task, you have to choose the right tool. And that’s not exactly easy, not least because of the sheer diversity of languages available. With this article, I will attempt to convince you that Python should be your choice — if only because it’s relatively easy to learn and has proven itself useful in a variety of fields.

So, without further ado, let’s dive in — and find out why you should consider Python for automation.

Why use Python for task automation?
Python offers great readability and approachable syntax. The latter resembles plain English, which makes it an excellent choice to start your journey with. When compared with other languages, Python clearly stands out as one of the simplest in the bunch. Look at this example of code written in C++ and Python.
