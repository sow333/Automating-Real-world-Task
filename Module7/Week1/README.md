# Qwiklabs Assessment: Scale and convert images using PIL
## Introduction
Your company is in the process of updating its website, and theyâ€™ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90Â° and too large. Oof! Youâ€™re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. Youâ€™ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

## What you'll do
Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:
* Open an image
* Rotate an image
* Resize an image
* Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory
